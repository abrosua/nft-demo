# Simple NFT playground (ERC-721 and ERC-1155)

Works to uncover in this project:
1. Creating a ERC-721 and ERC-1155 contract with Brownie and [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20). Deployed on [Sepolia Testnet](https://sepolia.dev/).
2. Generating NFT metadata and pinning files into IPFS ([pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/))

There are 3 types of NFT collectibles:
1. Simple Collectible (`scripts/simple_collectible/`), a simple ERC-721 where users manually defined the Token URI everytime they mint a token. There is no verification method on this collectible, therefore anyone can mint the token and impose any URI on it freely.
2. Advanced Collectible (`scripts/advanced_collectible/`), an [ERC-721 token](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x7546E10CD77D82c48E35409a9310999Da1Ad05aE) that will randomly choose an image (in `img/`) using VRF Coordinator V2 everytime a token is minted. The scripts are also capable of generating the suitable metadata for each minted token, automatically pin it to IPFS and set the token URI. Only owner and approved (available in `ERC721URIStorage`) sender that can set the token URI.
3. Multi Collectible (`scripts/advanced_collectible/`), an [ERC-1155 token](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x7296CD7371abCC79Add2069D06b418a21e750650) that will randomly choose which token will be minted everytime a user tries to create a collectible. All the available assets should be pinned to IPFS before deployment, since the contract does not use URI storage. Token URI will be automatically generated using the initialized base URI and token's contract ID. The token base URI can be updated after deployment by the owner only.
